# jit-may23b — JIT optimization queue (smaller chunks)

## /goal protocol

This doc drives a /goal loop. The rules below are LOAD-BEARING.
Past sessions stopped despite the previous doc's rules; these
are stricter.

### When the user sends a message mid-loop

1. Answer in ≤2 sentences.
2. Do NOT recap progress, restate the plan, or write
   "continuing now"/"keep going"/etc.
3. Immediately call the next tool to advance the next task.

The user reads diffs and commits to see progress. Don't reprint
what they can already see. After a user interrupt, the very next
thing you output should be a tool call, not prose.

### When a task completes

- Edit the doc to move the task to `## Closed` (1 line).
- Commit + push.
- IMMEDIATELY start the next task. No "Q5 done. Moving to Q6."
  preamble.

### When the queue is empty

DO NOT STOP. Instead:

1. Run `grep -n "if (std::getenv(\"" src/vm/Interpreter.cpp
   src/vm/Primitives.cpp src/vm/ObjectMemory.cpp` and check each
   hit for per-call pattern in a hot function (search for callers
   of the enclosing function in step/activateMethod/IC dispatch).
   If any found, add as tasks.
2. Profile + identify the next ≥100ms bench gap. Add tasks to
   address it.
3. Goal NEVER auto-clears. Keep working until the user explicitly
   says stop.

### Task sizing

Each task ≤15 min. If a task is bigger, split it. Sub-task names
get letter suffixes (e.g., R5a, R5b).

### "DONE WHEN" must be binary

- ✅ Binary: "file X line Y edited", "counter Z is non-zero",
  "bench-correctness 5/5 PASS".
- ❌ Open-ended: "audit ...", "identify ...", "characterize ...".

Open-ended tasks invite summary responses. Binary tasks force
action.

## Queue

### R10 — Run full bench-suite, record new baseline

ACTION: `PHARO_VM=/tmp/harness/pharo timeout 240 scripts/run_benchmarks.sh`
3 times. Record fib/sum/dict/sort/instVar/floatSum/stringHash
medians.
DONE: numbers in this doc under `## Bench-suite tracking`.

### R17 — Profile sum 1M with `sample` (macOS dtrace alt)

ACTION: `sample test_load_image 5` while bench-suite is running
sum. Capture top 10 symbols.
DONE: list pasted.

### R18 — Identify top non-JIT hot symbol from R17

ACTION: from R17 output, pick the hottest C++ symbol that ISN'T
JIT-emitted code. Look at its body for any optimizations.
DONE: 1 finding recorded.

### R19 — Implement 1 optimization from R18

ACTION: based on R18 finding, make 1 focused change.
DONE: edited + committed OR documented why not applicable.

### R20 — Profile floatSum 1M with `sample`

ACTION: same as R17 but for floatSum.
DONE: list pasted.

### R21 — Identify boxedFloat overhead

ACTION: floatSum uses SmallFloat for the running total, but each
+ might create a BoxedFloat. Look at Primitives.cpp prim 541
result encoding.
DONE: yes/no answer to "do we box".

### R22 — Profile instVar 1M with `sample`

ACTION: same.
DONE: list pasted.

### R23 — Profile collect 10x100K with `sample`

ACTION: same.
DONE: list pasted.

### R24 — Profile dict 50K with `sample`

ACTION: same.
DONE: list pasted.

### R25 — Profile sort 100K with `sample`

ACTION: same.
DONE: list pasted.

### R26 — Identify pattern across profiles (R17,R20-R25)

ACTION: which C++ symbol appears in ≥3 of the 6 bench profiles?
That's the highest-leverage fix target.
DONE: top shared symbol named.

### R27 — Pick one R26 symbol and audit body

ACTION: read the function. List any sub-operations that could be
inlined or skipped.
DONE: list of 3 candidates.

### R28 — Implement smallest R27 candidate

ACTION: make the edit. Bench-correctness 5/5 PASS.
DONE: commit.

### R29 — Measure R28's bench impact

ACTION: 3 runs of bench-suite. Compare to R16.
DONE: delta recorded; reverted if regressed.

### R30 — Move to next R27 candidate

ACTION: implement.
DONE: commit.

## Closed

- ✅ R1: line 2711 is at interp()'s cg_exit — runs once. NOT hot. No edit.
- ✅ R2: already cached at line 2260 (traceOpValue1).
- ✅ R3: executePrimitive entry had 2 per-call getenvs (TRACE_EXIT, TRACE_EXEC_PRIM). Cached both. 5/5 PASS.
- ✅ R4: already cached at line 16643 (static const lambda).
- ✅ R5: already cached at line 16700 (static const lambda).
- ✅ R6: cached at line 16803 (was uncached). Edited.
- ✅ R7: line 3414 inside `if (!semTraceInit)` one-shot. Fine.
- ✅ R8: full audit. Remaining `if (std::getenv(` hits are all cold:
  - 463-470: in ctor.
  - 1130: in JIT stats print.
  - 1532: in startup.
  - 2711, 2818: at exit paths.
  - 3414: one-shot init.
  - 11320: in DNU error.
  - 12348: in jitSistaSelfRecCall (sista counter=0, never fires).
  - 16644, 16701: already cached.
- ✅ R9: nothing to do (R8 found no hot uncached).
- ✅ R11+R12: Primitives.cpp — no hot uncached getenvs.
- ✅ R13: ObjectMemory.cpp — no uncached `if (std::getenv(` patterns.
- ✅ R16: bench-suite stable across 3 runs.  Same numbers as R10.
- ✅ R14+R15: src/vm/jit/ audit. All getenvs are in compile-time
  paths (JIT stats print, T2 log, AsmjitT1 compile log, Sista
  compile dump).  None per-call.  Two
  at exit paths (3787, 3794).  Lines 1888, 10031 already cached.
  Other getenv uses are `const char*` getters (not boolean checks).

## Bench-suite tracking

R10 baseline (after R1-R9 caching of executePrimitive et al):

| Bench | Session start | After R3 caching | Δ from start |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| fib(28) | 179 | 154 | -14% |
| sieve x100 | 8 | 8 | = |
| sort 100K | 835 | 337 | **-60%** |
| dict 50K | 447 | 301 | -33% |
| sum 1M | 284 | 101 | **-64%** |
| factorial 5K | 21 | 22 | +5% |
| instVar 1M | 260 | 106 | **-59%** |
| 100K alloc | 13 | 5 | **-62%** |
| floatSum 1M | 402 | 119 | **-70%** |
| stringHash 100K | 169 | 103 | -39% |
| collect 10x100K | 510 | 243 | **-52%** |
| select 10x100K | 643 | 354 | -45% |

**TOTAL bench-suite time roughly halved** by caching 2 getenv
calls in executePrimitive entry.  executePrimitive is the entry
point for EVERY VM primitive call — millions per bench-suite —
and the uncached getenvs at lines 16007/16012 cost ~50% on
prim-heavy benches.
